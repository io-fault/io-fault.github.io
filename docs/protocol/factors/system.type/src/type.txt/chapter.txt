[ Controls ]

The set of runtime features needed for correct imaging.

/`exceptions`/
	System runtime exceptions support.

	Stating `(control)&<http://if.fault.io/factors/system.type#exceptions>` as a requirement will
	cause factors depending on the symbol to enable exceptions.

	Primarily, this is intended for `C++`, but other languages that feature it as an option
	may use this endpoint. Notably, this will effect `C` as well if designated as a requirement.

	For `clang` and `gcc` compilers, this will issue `-fexceptions` as a compilation argument
	instead of `-fno-exceptions`.

/`rtti`/
	Runtime Type Information support.

	Stating `(control)&<http://if.fault.io/factors/system.type#rtti>` as a requirement will
	cause factors depending on the symbol to enable RTTI.

	Primarily, this is intended for `C++`, but other languages that feature it as an option
	may use this endpoint.

	For `clang` and `gcc` compilers, this will issue `-frtti` as a compilation argument instead
	of `-fno-rtti`.

/`pi`/
	For systems supporting runtime relocations, this control field designates the image
	as supporting independant positioning.
