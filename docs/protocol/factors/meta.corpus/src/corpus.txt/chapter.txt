A collection of resources that intends to constitute a set of projects.
Usually, a corpus serves as a logical set of factors organized by their projects.
When deployed within an environment, the projects are integrated into a (project-local/unknown)&<meta.product>.

Corpora may be represented as factors with this type, but usually the concept exists
outside of installations.
