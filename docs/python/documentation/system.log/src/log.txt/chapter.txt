Ideas or plans for changes.

[ > Execution Plan Abstractions ]

(project-local/unknown)&<execution> defines serialization and parsing functions for system execution plans.
Using these functions directly is not ideal as some semantics are implied with
their usage(the exact format).

Define a new interface for abstracting the implementation of the format:
(project-local/unknown)&<execution.prepare> and (project-local/unknown)&<execution.snapshot>. In addition to parsing the plan
string, this will construct a (project-local/unknown)&<execution.KInvocation> instance directly for use.
On the inverse, (project-local/unknown)&<execution.snapshot>, will take a (project-local/unknown)&<execution.KInvocation> instance
and return a serialized plan for storage.

Interfaces working with plan files may also be created. (project-local/unknown)&<execution.fs_load> and
(project-local/unknown)&<execution.fs_store>.

[ > Integration of Thread Module ]

(project-local/unknown)&<thread> provides a set of aliases to functions and types within Python's _thread module.
(project-local/unknown)&<process> depends on it unconditionally and it is natural to consider threads
a Process resource. (project-local/unknown)&<thread> as an independent module provides no utility outside
of a categorization method.

[ > Restricting I/O Transits to Octets ]

Python's object system is flexible to accommodate (project-local/unknown)&<io'> current design. However, the design
heavily favors stream connections and Transit types other than (project-local/unknown)&<io.Octets> are unlikely to be
used. The connection-less nature of UDP makes Datagrams an odd choice of interface for
services and sometimes clients.

The one exception is (project-local/unknown)&<io.Sockets> which is a uni-directional Transit that accepts socket
connections. In order to simplify (project-local/unknown)&<io>, (project-local/unknown)&<events> needs to take responsibility for managing
listening sockets.
