This file *should* contain system.io *specific* tests.
Primarily, invasive tests that rely on implementation specific functionality.

Arguably, there's quite a bit of redundancy in this file.
However, cases analyzed here that appear similar often have one-off cases
that make it rather annoying to generalize.
